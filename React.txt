ðŸ”¹ React Basics

What is React? Why is it used?

What are the differences between React and Angular/Vue?

What are the main features of React?

What is JSX, and why do we use it?

What are components in React? Explain functional vs class components.

What is the virtual DOM, and how is it different from the real DOM?

What are props in React?

What is state in React? How is it different from props?

ðŸ”¹ Hooks (very common in interviews!)

What are React hooks, and why were they introduced?

Explain useState, useEffect, and useRef with examples.

Difference between useMemo and useCallback.

When would you use useReducer instead of useState?

How does useContext work?

How do custom hooks work? Have you written one?

ðŸ”¹ Component Lifecycle

Explain the React component lifecycle methods.

Difference between componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

How are lifecycle methods replaced in functional components with hooks?

ðŸ”¹ Performance & Optimization

What causes re-renders in React?

How do you prevent unnecessary re-renders? (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback)

What is reconciliation in React?

What is code-splitting, and how do you implement it?

Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components.

ðŸ”¹ Advanced React

What is React Fiber?

What is context API, and how is it different from Redux?

When would you use Redux over Context?

Explain Reactâ€™s key prop. Why is it important?

How does server-side rendering (SSR) work in React (e.g., Next.js)?

What is hydration in React?

What is React Concurrent Mode (or concurrent features like useTransition)?

ðŸ”¹ Practical/Scenario-based Questions

How do you handle forms in React?

How do you fetch data in React? Where do you make API calls?

How would you debounce or throttle an input field in React?

How do you implement authentication in React?

How do you implement infinite scrolling or pagination?

How do you share state between components?

How would you build a modal/toast system in React?

ðŸ”¹ Testing in React

How do you test React components?

What are Jest and React Testing Library?

Difference between unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

ðŸ”¹ Tricky/Common Interview Questions

What is the difference between shadow DOM and virtual DOM?

Why do we need keys in lists? What happens if we donâ€™t use them?

Why are React hooks rules important (only call at top level, not inside loops)?

Difference between useEffect(() => {}, []) and useEffect(() => {}).

What is prop drilling, and how do you avoid it?

How do you handle error boundaries in React?

ðŸ”¹ MNC vs Startup focus

MNCs â†’ More theory-heavy, lifecycle, performance optimizations, design patterns (Redux, Context, SSR, large-scale architecture).

Startups â†’ More practical, hands-on coding challenges (e.g., build a todo app, infinite scroll, search with debounce, custom hooks).
